# MachineLearningCourse
Andrew Ng's Coursera Course

This Machine Learning course used Octave as the programming language to help non-programmers enter the world of machine learning.  The simple syntax helped students learn the concept and mathematics behind building each classifier.  Below are the topic of each exercise and their instructions will be in the attached pdf document in each folder.

ex1: Linear Regression
ex2: Logistic Regression
ex3: Multi-class Classification and Neural Network
ex4: Neural Network Learning
ex5: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias/Variance
ex6: Support Vector Machines
ex7: K-Means Clustering and PCA
ex8: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
